# Architectural Mimicry: Innovative Instructions to Efficiently Address Control-Flow Leakage in Data-Oblivious Programs

Architectural Mimicry (AMi) is a hardware-software co-designed countermeasure to prevent leaking secrets via a program's control flow. For more information about AMi, we refer to our [S&P 2024 paper](https://mici.hu/papers/winderix24ami.pdf).
